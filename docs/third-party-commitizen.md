## Third-Party Commitizen Templates

In addition to the native templates, some alternative commit format templates
are available as PyPI packages (installable with `pip`).

### [Conventional JIRA](https://pypi.org/project/conventional-JIRA/)

Just like *conventional commit* format, but the scope has been restricted to a
JIRA issue format, i.e. `project-issueNumber`. This standardises scopes in a
meaningful way.

It can be installed with `pip install conventional-JIRA`.

### [Commitizen emoji](https://pypi.org/project/commitizen-emoji/)

Just like *conventional commit* format, but with emojis and optionally time spent and related tasks.

It can be installed with `pip install commitizen-emoji`.

Usage: `cz --name cz_commitizen_emoji commit`.
